      this site does not use cookies. it uses html and css, and a little

      as much as possible, this site does not use anything that works only with
      pointing devices. e.g. such as <code>hover</code> and <code>cursor</code>.
      this is an experiment on accessibility.

      this site basically consists only of lowercase letters and symbols, does
      not use uppercase letters. this is an experiment on information overload.
