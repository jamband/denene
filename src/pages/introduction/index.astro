    <p>
      this site does not use cookies. it uses html and css, and a little
      javascript. it's an experimental site to think about what we can do in
      such a situation.
    </p>
  </PageSection>
  <PageSection>
    <PageSubHeader title="2" />
    <p>
      as much as possible, this site does not use anything that works only with
      pointing devices. e.g. such as
      <Code code="hover" /> and <Code code="cursor" />. this is an experiment on
      accessibility.
    </p>
  </PageSection>
  <PageSection>
    <PageSubHeader title="3" />
    <p>
      this site basically consists only of lowercase letters and symbols, does
      not use uppercase letters. this is an experiment on information overload.
