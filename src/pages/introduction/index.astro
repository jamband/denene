        this site does not use cookies. it uses html and css, and a little
        javascript. it's an experimental site to think about what we can do in
        such a situation.

    <PageSection>
      <PageSubHeader title="2" />
      <p>
        as much as possible, this site does not use anything that works only
        with pointing devices. e.g. such as <code>hover</code> and <code
          >cursor</code
        >. this is an experiment on accessibility.

      <p>
        this site basically consists only of lowercase letters and symbols, does
        not use uppercase letters. this is an experiment on information
        overload.
